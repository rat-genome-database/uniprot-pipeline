  protein loader:
    optimized handling of protein sequences

      between the incoming sequence and the sequence in rgd

  secondary accession ids are now imported as aliases (previously they have been ignored)

Sep 3, 2015 - build 1.7.1
  improved summary email


Jun 19, 2015 - build 1.7.0
--------------------------
significantly revamped logic
1) matching algorithm change:
  incoming data is matched to RGD data in the following order (as below);
  matching is terminated as soon there is some matching data
  OLD logic:
    RGD, GeneId, HGNC, MGI, UniProt, RefSeq Nucl, Ensembl
  NEW logic:
    GeneId, HGNC, MGI, RefSeq Nucl, UniProt, Ensembl
2) improved handling of multis: where one UniProtKB id matches multiple genes in RGD
   previous logic was not properly handling of up to 0.1% of uniprot ids
3) discontinued ids_merged.log
  ids_inserted and ids_deleted logs until June 22, 2015 contain a lot of duplication:
  due to code flaw some entries are unnecessarily inserted, and during next pipeline run they are deleted and so on
  therefore as of June 22, 2015 these logs are discontinued;
  inserted.log and deleted.log are used instead


Mar 6, 2015 - build 1.6.5
  updated jars

Dec 15, 2014 - build 1.6.4
  updated jars; in pipeline logs totals, [IGNORED] databases are no longer listed explicitly (this info
    is of little value and it was significantly cluttering the summary)

Jul 3, 2014 - build 1.6.3
  improved summary emails by removing redundant information

May 23, 2014 - build 1.6.2 - per RGDD-926
  fixed processing of AC lines: primary uniprot acc id is the first acc id on the first AC line
    when a record had multiple AC lines, the other AC lines must be ignored;
  fixed importing of gene Ensembl ids

Nov 25, 2013 - build 1.6.1
  fixed reporting of MERGED ids in ids_merged.log (logs will be significantly smaller)

Apr 9, 2013 - build 1.6.0
  improved logic in processing of RGD_IDS

Dec 21, 2012 - build 1.5.3
  updated rgdcore so inserts into RGD_ACC_XDB table use sequence RGD_ACC_XDB_SEQ

October 18, 2012 - build 1.5.2
  1) added logging of inserted and deleted uniprot ids
  2) showing the pipeline run time in seconds minutes and hours instead of seconds only

August 30, 2012 - per jira ticket RGDD-558
  loading of RefSeq proteins discontinued

May 2012 changes - per jira ticker RGDD-473
  generates a file with list of primary and secondary accession ids for sprot database

February 2012 changes - per jira ticket RGDD-344
  1) stricter QC logic: load protein ids only for genes of corresponding species
  2) extended processing for mouse and human: QC matches by HGNC IDs and MGI ids
  3) QC matching logic is looking for both UniProtKB ids (map_key=14) and GeneBank Protein ids (map_key=7)
  4) Pipeline logic approved by Jennifer and Liz
  5) Report extracts customized for every species
